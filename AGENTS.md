## 🎯 My Purpose

My primary goal is to assist with the development and maintenance of the BLU_Classic addon by analyzing code, managing files, and executing tasks according to established repository standards.

*   **Shell Commands:** I can execute shell commands for tasks like searching, listing files, and running scripts.
*   **Project Information:** I can provide information about the project based on its files.

## 📂 Repository Structure

*   **`.github/workflows/`**: Contains GitHub Actions for automation.
    *   `release.yml`: Automates the packaging and release process when a new version tag is pushed.
    *   `copy-secrets.yml`: A manual workflow to sync secrets to the BLU_Classic repository.
*   **`data/`**: The core logic of the addon.
    *   `core.lua`: Handles the addon's main event logic.
    *   `initialization.lua`: Manages addon startup, version detection, and event registration.

    *   `options.lua`: Defines the in-game configuration panel and its options.
    *   `sounds.lua`: Maps all sound files, including custom and default sounds.
    *   `utils.lua`: Provides helper functions for event queuing, sound playback, and slash commands.
    *   `battlepets.lua`: Contained logic for battle pet level-up sounds.
*   **`docs/`**: Project documentation.
    *   `guidelines_changelog.md`: Defines the format for changelogs.
    *   `changelog.txt`: The complete history of changes.
    *   `CHANGES.md`: A list of changes for the next upcoming release.
*   **`images/`**: Contains addon assets like icons.
*   **`Libs/`**: Contains third-party libraries, primarily the Ace3 framework.
*   **`sounds/`**: Contains all `.ogg` sound files.
*   **`.toc` Files**: (`BLU_Classic.toc`, `BLU_Classic_Vanilla.toc`, `BLU_Classic_Mists.toc`) Table of Contents files that tell WoW how to load the addon for different game versions.
*   **`README.md`**: The main project overview.

## 📝 Repository Standards

I am aware of and will adhere to the following standards:

*   **`.toc` File Path Separators:** I will use the correct path separator style for each `.toc` file (`/` for Retail/Cata, `\` for Mists, `\` for Vanilla).
*   **Changelog:** I will follow the strict format outlined in `docs/guidelines_changelog.md` when updating `CHANGES.md` and `changelog.txt`.

## 🤝 How to Interact With Me

You can direct me with natural language commands to perform the tasks outlined above.

## Repository Workflow

- The GitLab project under `rgxmods/warcraft` is authoritative. Normal work belongs on task branches and must merge through GitLab merge requests, never directly to the default branch.
- Shared CI is included from `rgxmods/warcraft/RGX-Framework` at `/.gitlab/ci/addon.yml`; validation must pass before publishing to the GitHub mirror.
- The GitHub `RGXMods` repository is downstream distribution, not development authority.
- Keep GitLab and GitHub release tags identical, and use protected GitLab release tags.
- Preserve any existing working Wago connection and ID exactly. Never create a new Wago connection without explicit user direction.
- Publishing integrations prohibited by the shared validation policy are retired and must not be restored.
- The root `README.md` must remain detailed and project-specific. Narrow distribution edits must not replace or truncate installation, features, compatibility, usage, media, or support content.
- Verify relative README assets. Do not overwrite newer compatibility facts with stale monorepo or history text.
